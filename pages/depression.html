            font-size: xx-large; font-weight: 1000;"><b>What is Postpartum Depression? </b></h2>
             
            <div class="content">
                <p style="font-size: large;">Postpartum depression is a condition that some women 
                    experience after having a baby. It involves different changes in their bodies, 
                    feelings, and actions. The diagnosis is based on how serious and long-lasting 
                    the depression is and when it starts, usually within four weeks after giving birth.</p>  
        
                    <p style="font-size: large;">The depression is connected to various factors. 
                        One is the quick drop in hormones after delivery. Hormones are chemicals 
                        in the body that affect how we feel. During pregnancy, hormone levels go 
                        up a lot, but they drop quickly after giving birth. This sudden change in 
                        hormones might be linked to depression, but we're still not sure exactly how.</p>
        
                        <p style="font-size: large;">Other factors are the social and emotional 
                            changes that come with having a baby. Taking care of a newborn can be
                             challenging, and it can affect a woman's mood and well-being.</p>
        
                            <p style="font-size: large;">Most new mothers feel a bit down after 
                                giving birth, which is called the "baby blues." But about one out 
                                of ten women will experience a more serious and longer-lasting 
                                depression after having a baby. In rare cases, some women develop 
                                a condition called postpartum psychosis, which is more severe.</p>
        
                                <p style="font-size: large;">It's important to know that dads can 
                                    also get depressed after their baby is born. About one in ten new 
                                    fathers experience depression during the first year of their child's life.</p>
        
                                    <p style="font-size: large;">Treatment for postpartum depression usually 
                                        involves taking medication and talking to a counselor or therapist who 
                                        can provide support and guidance.</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">Postpartum depression can be difficult to notice, but many women 
                experience these signs after giving birth:
                
                    <ul style="margin-left: 7%; margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-size: large;" type = "square">

                    <li>Changes in appetite.</li>
                    <li>Feeling extremely tired.</li>
                    <li>Decreased interest in pleasure.</li>
                    <li>Mood swings.</li>
                   
                  </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-size: large;">With postpartum depression, these symptoms are accompanied 
             by other signs of major depression that are not typical after childbirth. These can include:
                
             <ul style="margin-left: 7%; margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-size: large;" type = "square">

                    <li>Crying often without a clear reason.</li>
                    <li>Feeling consistently sad.</li>
                    <li>Being extremely angry or irritable.</li>
                    <li>Losing interest in things you used to enjoy.</li>
                    <li>Feeling worthless, hopeless, or helpless.</li>
                    <li>Having thoughts of death or suicide.</li>
                    <li>Having thoughts of hurting someone else.</li>
                    <li>Difficulty concentrating or making decisions.</li>
                  </ul>
            </p>
        
            <p style="font-size: large;">In some cases, women may also experience symptoms of 
                obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or panic disorder alongside depression.</p>

        <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 400;">Postpartum depression is not your fault, and it can happen for various reasons. 
        Some factors that increase the chances of experiencing postpartum depression include:
        
        <ul style="margin-left: 7%; margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-size: large;" type = "square">
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Having a history of depression before or during pregnancy.</li>
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Being young when you become pregnant.</li>
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling unsure or conflicted about the pregnancy.</li>
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Having multiple children, as the risk may increase with each pregnancy.</li>
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Having a family history of mood disorders.</li>
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Going through highly stressful events like job loss or health problems.</li>
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Having a child with special needs or health issues.</li>
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Giving birth to twins or triplets.</li>
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Having a history of depression or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).</li>
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Having limited social support.</li>
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Living alone.</li>
           <li style="font-weight: 400;">Experiencing conflict in your marriage or relationship.</li>
         </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 400;">There isn't a specific cause for postpartum depression, but 
        certain physical and emotional factors may contribute to it:<br>
        
        <ul style="margin-left: 7%; margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-size: large;" type = "square">
           <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Hormonal changes:</span><br> After giving birth, 
            there is a significant drop in estrogen and progesterone levels, which can affect your mood. 
            Thyroid hormone levels may also decrease, leading to feelings of fatigue, sluggishness, and depression.</li><br>
        
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Lack of sleep:</span> <br>When you are 
                sleep-deprived and overwhelmed, even small problems can feel challenging to handle.</li><br>
        
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Anxiety: </span><br>
                    Worries about your ability to take care of your newborn can contribute to postpartum depression.</li><br>
        
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Self-image:</span> <br>Feeling less 
                        attractive, struggling with your sense of identity, or feeling a loss of control over your 
                        life can all play a role in postpartum depression.</li><br>
         </ul>

        <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 400;">There are <b><u>three terms</u></b> used to describe the mood changes 
        women can have after giving birth:<br>
        
        <ul style="margin-left: 7%; margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-size: large;" type = "square">
           <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: larger;"">Baby Blues:</span><br> happens to as many 
            as 70% of women in the days right after childbirth. You may have sudden mood swings, such as 
            feeling very happy and then feeling very sad. You may cry for no reason and can feel impatient, 
            cranky, restless, anxious, lonely, and sad. The baby blues may last only a few hours or as long 
            as 1 to 2 weeks after delivery. Usually you don’t need treatment from a health care provider for 
            baby blues. Often, joining a support group of new moms or talking with other moms helps.</li><br>
        
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: larger;">Postpartum depression (PPD):</span><br>
                can happen a few days or even months after childbirth. PPD can happen after the birth of any 
                child, not just the first child. You can have feelings similar to the baby blues -- sadness, 
                despair, anxiety, crankiness -- but you feel them much more strongly.<br> PPD often keeps you 
                from doing the things you need to do every day. When your ability to function is affected, 
                you need to see a health care provider, such as your OB/GYN or primary care doctor. This 
                doctor can screen you for depression symptoms and come up with a treatment plan. If you don’t 
                get treatment for PPD, symptoms can get worse. While PPD is a serious condition, it can be 
                treated with medication and counseling.</li><br>
        
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: larger;">Postpartum psychosis:</span><br>
                    is a very serious mental illness that can affect new mothers. This illness can happen quickly, 
                    often within the first 3 months after childbirth.<br> Women can lose touch with reality, having 
                    auditory hallucinations (hearing things that aren't actually happening, like a person talking) 
                    and delusions (strongly believing things that are clearly irrational).<br> Visual hallucinations 
                    (seeing things that aren't there) are less common. <br>Other symptoms include insomnia (not being able to sleep), 
                    feeling agitated and angry, pacing, restlessness, and strange feelings and behaviors.<br> Women who have 
                    postpartum psychosis need treatment right away and almost always need medication. Sometimes women are 
                    put into the hospital because they are at risk for hurting themselves or someone else.</li><br>

                to a mental health professional who can provide support, guidance, and strategies to cope 
                with postpartum depression.</li><br>
        
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 700; ">Support groups: </span><br>
                    Joining a support group for new mothers can provide emotional support and education about 
                    postpartum depression. Sharing experiences with others who understand what you're going 
                    through can be helpful.</li><br>
        
                    
         </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 400;">In the case of postpartum psychosis, additional medications 
        used to treat psychosis may be prescribed. Hospital admission is often necessary to ensure the safety of 
        the mother and others.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 400;">If you are breastfeeding, it's important to have a conversation 
        with your doctor. Many medications used to treat postpartum depression, anxiety, or psychosis can be taken 
        while breastfeeding, under a doctor's supervision.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 400;">The treatment approach will be determined based on your 
            individual situation, and it's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to find the 
            most suitable treatment plan.</p>
