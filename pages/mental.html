            font-size: xx-large; font-weight: 1000;"><b>This is for you new moms.. </b></h2>
            <br>
            <div class="content">
                <p style="font-size: large;">Becoming a mother brings about various changes and sacrifices, 
                    such as sleep, exercise, warm meals, and uninterrupted showers. However, the glimpses 
                    of motherhood portrayed on social media, with tired moms sipping cold coffee and dealing 
                    with leaky boobs, only scratch the surface. The true state of mental health for new moms, 
                    especially in the first year, remains largely unshared. Courtney Amerin and Katie Danielson, 
                    creators of the PUSH Revolution podcast, stress the importance of preparing for the postpartum 
                    period alongside the birth plan. While much attention is given to birth preparations, 
                    the postpartum period spans the entire first year and requires a different level of support 
                    for both the body and mind.</p>  

                    <p style="font-size: large;">Expectant parents often educate themselves on the symptoms 
                        of postpartum depression, and women are screened for potential mental health 
                        challenges. However, once thrust into the fourth trimester, recognizing the 
                        signs is not always straightforward. Danielson notes that postpartum mental 
                        health challenges extend beyond depression and can include anxiety, PTSD, OCD, 
                        and, in rare cases, postpartum psychosis. Most women experience a shift in mood 
                        within a few days after giving birth, known as the "baby blues," which usually 
                        subside after two weeks. However, for some, feelings of sadness and depression 
                        persist, leading to postpartum depression. Statistics indicate that one in eight 
                        women experience depression within the first six months after delivery. It's 
                        evident that every mother will face some degree of mental health challenge 
                        due to hormonal changes, identity shifts, sleep deprivation, and adjusting to 
                        caring for a newborn.</p>

            font-size: xx-large; font-weight: 1000;"><b>A guide to prepare you for your postpartum journey</b></h2>

            <h3 style = "text-align: left; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; 
            font-size: x-large; font-weight: 800;"><b>1. Arrange talk therapy sessions</b></h3>

            
            <p style="font-size: large;">The postpartum experience encompasses two 
                contrasting truths: the overwhelming love and excitement of having 
                a new baby, and the grueling challenges of caring for and adjusting 
                to motherhood. It is essential to have conversations and seek therapy 
                as a cornerstone of the healing process. Engaging in therapy allows for 
                emotional processing, addressing birth trauma, and promoting self-care. 
                Involving a partner in therapy can provide additional support and equip 
                couples with tools to navigate this transformative phase.</p>


             <h3 style = "text-align: left; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; 
             font-size: x-large; font-weight: 800;"><b>2. Build a strong support system</b></h3>

            
            <p style="font-size: large;">Assemble your postpartum support network: therapist, 
                pelvic floor physio, massage therapist, pediatrician, personal trainer, and 
                lactation consultant. Research and collect their information for convenient 
                access, ensuring they align with your needs and preferences during this 
                transformative time.</p>
                
             

             <h3 style = "text-align: left; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; 
             font-size: x-large; font-weight: 800;"><b>3. Recover your body, restore your mind. </b></h3>
 
             
             <p style="font-size: large;">Pregnancy and childbirth bring changes to the body, 
                but regaining strength is possible. Manage expectations and opt for postpartum-specific 
                workouts, whether online or in your community. Consider using apps like Juna, offering 
                expert-designed workouts for safe and healthy postnatal recovery. </p>
               

              <h3 style = "text-align: left; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; 
              font-size: x-large; font-weight: 800;"><b>4. Discuss important topics with your partner. </b> </h3>
 
            
             <p style="font-size: large;">Prepare for the changes in your relationship when becoming 
                new parents. Prioritize important conversations beforehand, covering topics like sleep 
                deprivation, sharing responsibilities, self-care needs, and managing household tasks. 
                Clear communication is key as you navigate the new-baby phase together. </p>
                

              <h3 style = "text-align: left; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; 
              font-size: x-large; font-weight: 800;"><b>5. Prioritize personal space and self-care. </b> </h3>
 
             
             <p style="font-size: large;">Caring for a newborn is tough, and becoming a mother 
                involves a significant identity shift. It's normal to feel discomfort and grieve 
                your previous self. Dr. Alexandra Sacks likens this transition to puberty, urging 
                self-reflection and acceptance. Journaling, meditating, and reflecting on the changes 
                can aid in embracing motherhood's challenges and transformations. </p>
                
              

              <h3 style = "text-align: left; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; 
              font-size: x-large; font-weight: 800;"><b>6. Create a supportive community of fellow moms.</b> </h3>
  
             
              <p style="font-size: large;">Modern communities no longer provide the support 
                they once did, leaving new parents feeling isolated. However, you can create 
                your own village by reaching out to fellow moms who can assist you in moments 
                when you need a break. Cultivate a support system through apps like Peanut and 
                local community spaces offering playgroups and gatherings. Dispelling the supermom 
                stereotype is crucial for a new mom's mental health. Embrace the idea of leaning 
                on others and find solace in the camaraderie of moms facing similar challenges. 
                Remember, it's okay to ask for help and rely on your newfound village during the 
                beautiful chaos of new motherhood.</p><br>
